# Protobuf Style Guidelines

Following the style guidelines will help maintain consistency and readability across the project. 

Most important guidelines to follow:

- File names should use lower_snake_case.
- Packages should be in lowercase and unique, following the corresponding namespaces from the project.
- Message names should use PascalCase, and fields names should use lower_snake_case.
- For repeated fields, the name should be pluralized.
- Enumerations should use PascalCase, and enum types should use CAPITALS.

Guidelines are based on the  [Protobuf Style Guidelines](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/style/).

Thank you for your cooperation!
